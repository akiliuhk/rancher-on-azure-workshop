# Kubernetes Management with SUSE Rancher on Microsoft Azure



## Abstract and learning objectives

This is an in-depth workshops designed to give DevOps and IT teams the hands-on skills they need to deploy and manage Kubernetes everywhere with SUSE Rancher running on Microsoft Azure.

 

The content will be delivered by technical experts and aim to educate anyone interested in learning how to use containers or Kubernetes.

 

During these virtual hands-on workshops, our technical experts will provide an introduction to Rancher, Docker, and Kubernetes and then walk through the steps for deploying a Kubernetes cluster.

 

The key topics that will be covered at the workshop include:

- Docker and Kubernetes Concepts and Architecture
- Installation and Configuration of Rancher Server
- Kubernetes Cluster Deployment
- Application Deployment and Access



## Overview

TODO: Describe a scenario here.



## Solution architecture

This is what we are going to build in this workshop. We will create a resource group to contain the resources to be deployed in this workshop. Then, we will deploy Rancher Server as a VM within this resource group. We will then configure the Rancher Server to automate the provisioning of Kubernetes (based on RKE2) into the same resource group but different subnets. We will then explore some management and application deployment features in Rancher.
